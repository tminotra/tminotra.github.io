    The last decade has seen a 50% decline in the number of new HIV infections. According to more recent National AIDS Control Organisation data, India has demonstrated an overall reduction of 57 percent in estimated annual new HIV infections (among adult population) from 0.274 million in 2000 to 0.116 million in 2011, and the estimated number of people living with HIV was 2.08 million in 2011.</p>
    <p>The numbers increased from 140,000 in 1990 to 57,0000 in 1996 gradually with simultaneous increase. The numbers then dropped drasctically. The first National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) was implemented over seven years (1992 to 1999), focused on monitoring HIV infection rates among risk populations in selected urban areas. The second phase ran between 1999 and 2006 and the original program was expanded at state level, focusing on targeted interventions for high-risk groups and preventive interventions among the general population A National Council on AIDS was formed during this phase, consisting of 31 ministries and chaired by the Prime Minister.

     <p>In 2009 India established a "National HIV and AIDS Policy and the World of Work", which sought to end discrimination against workers on the basis of their real or perceived HIV status. Under this policy all enterprises in the public, private, formal and informal sectors are encouraged to establish workplace policies and programmes based on the principles of non-discrimination, gender equity, health work environment, non-screening for the purpose of employment, confidentiality, prevention and care and support.
